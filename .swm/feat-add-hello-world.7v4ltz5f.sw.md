# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the "Hello World" feature. This feature is a simple console log statement that prints "Hello World" to the console. It's a basic feature, but it's a good starting point for understanding the codebase and the development process. We will cover:

1.  Why we chose to implement this feature in a separate JavaScript file.

2.  How this feature fits into the overall project structure.

3.  The importance of the console log statement in debugging and development.

# Implementation of the "Hello World" Feature

## Choosing the Implementation File

<br/>

The "Hello World" feature was implemented in a separate JavaScript file located in the `ðŸ“„ .github/workflows` directory. This decision was made to keep the codebase organized and modular. By placing the feature in its own file, we can easily locate and modify it if necessary. This also allows us to isolate the feature from the rest of the codebase, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.

### ðŸ“„ .github/workflows/sample.js
```javascript
5      // add console log "hello world"
6      console.log("hello world");
7      
```

<br/>

## The Role of the Console Log Statement

<br/>

The console log statement is a fundamental tool in JavaScript development. It allows developers to print messages to the console, which can be extremely useful for debugging purposes. In this case, the console log statement prints the string "Hello World". This is a simple message, but it serves as a confirmation that the code is running correctly. If the message is not printed to the console, it indicates that there is an issue with the code that needs to be addressed.

```

# Conclusion

The "Hello World" feature is a simple but important part of the codebase. It serves as a starting point for understanding the codebase and the development process. By implementing this feature in a separate file and using a console log statement, we have created a modular and debuggable piece of code that can be easily understood and modified.
